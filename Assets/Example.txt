Hey Tre, there's a moo. Those who are a fan of mooing, I know one such person, but uh Oh, yeah. But Bob, I don't think there's any unicorns on this thing, but I guess I'm watching out for them anyway. a uniform one. Echo whiskey 7 purple, black, green, blue, red, red. No match. No, no, no. Everything crosses. Nothing goes to a black star. Um, okay. Let's I do that a lot. Um, so because everything crosses, I could just do this. Um, and because nothing goes to a black star, I can also do this. Um, yeah, we do have that match. Uh, do I want to deal with it now? I want to deal with it now. So, it's this. It's a match. It's not an even position. It does cross another wire. Seal number vowel. Yes. So, I do want to cut that one. Uh, purple. Um, well, that's the only one where it's match. So now we have this. It's just parody now. Um, no. Yes. And then up here is arrow direction unique. No. Um, that one isn't unique either. And then arrow direction up or down? No. Cut. Cut. That's my janky way of doing perplexing wires. Um, good box. Something giving you I'm the tiniest bit flustered. Um, here. Why that door wasn't locked, I have no idea. That is entirely on me. But there is also a clearly established do not disturb sign. So, it's also their fault. Um, anyway, we have a dog. We have a dog. Uh, there's a lot of dogs apparently. How about graduation cap? Okay. Well, really? Okay. Um, or whatever that is. Dog. I guess you might just sift through dogs. Dog. Dogs. chef's hat. Really? That's not I mean, I guess it is, but I also don't approve of it. Uh, woman Carefree woman on beach. I wouldn't blame anyone for not getting that one right. Uh, car crash into a pole. Car crash into pole. Let's go. Um, 53. Let's get the number right. 53984. The bulb is on. See through. So yes. Um, I I unscrew I screw. Um, detonate button. Not the button. Light detonate. Thank you. Crazy talk. Um risky. He is one two probably will activate claxon if I had guess. No. Okay. One, two, three. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three. One, two, three, four. Yellow. Yellow. Blue. Machanta. Yellow. Yellow, blue, magenta, blue, blue, magenta, green. mod kit. My beloved RJ Delta uniform one echo whiskey 7 alphabet LED arrows. Okay. Two or more LEDs have the same color. Um serial number is four or more digits. No. Key is number is even key appears before L. Um up press up stage right is not green bob indicator. Yes. Keys number is less than six. Press four more batteries. Keys number is prime. Up or down arrow is blue. Keys letter is a vowel. Otherwise, um third color is blue. Uh red becomes blue. Red, yellow becomes this. This red, yellow, green, red, yellow, green. Cool. Six is the sea. Green or cyan, I guess. Green, blue, orange, yellow, red, purple. Um, sh H A R E S shares. Yes. Poetry. That's what it's called. Energy. Energy. Energy, energy, energy, clarity, sunshine. Um, that's was 36. Snip it. Flip it. Slide it. Flip it. Slide it. Tilt it. Tilt it. Solve it. Boggers. Uh third was green mustard white scarlet plum revolver candlestick dagger in the billyard No deep batteries. Use two uh mustard. Wait plum on the lounge. Not that many batteries. There is a serial port. Use row nine. Revolver, rope, candlestick, dagger. Um, uh, it was white with the candlestick in the library. I mean, do I really need to write all of this out anymore? I never know when things can disabate, I guess. Um battery count digits and serial NF P A7 04 number of consonants and integers 1 2 3 4 21 is antifreeze blue is white plates yellow is red uh 31 1 0 or 1 13 0. Guess I should do it left, right. Um, yellow becomes red, red becomes white, and blue becomes yellow. Red, red, white, white, yellow. And finally, triple0. Triple0 is right here. Red becomes red, yellow becomes blue, white becomes yellow. So that's red, blue, yellow, yellow, yellow. Oh, it's going to be our key, isn't it? I could just submit Q if I think it's good. Um, sunshine. Yeah, I don't see any Q's up there. Do I see everything else? M A R. Um, well, I shouldn't be putting all this mental effort in if it's for not. Um, so T O R I S starts with an L. It's laboratories. It's not even Marque Morris. Are you kidding me? a hyper cube. What's XW? XW or is that one WX? Yes. Let's say that one's Z Y. No. or it's YZ want to say that checks out and then this line becomes that line. Is it CW? I think it's WZ. YZ. WZ. Okay. WZ is this one. Um, XW. Zigg this cube back is up here. Blue wx. Zag that cube back back here. Green is there. Dy top. What I can see front down there. Yellow and YZ top what I can see right over here. Red. Good. Down. Move. Okay. Um, f I N D V is not I N. I mean, I don't think there's a V in there. I S I B L E C O W. Thank you for holding. Your call is important to us. I remember what the module's called now. It's our bracing. Bravo. White. If same. Different. Same. Different same same different same same different same difference different. Uh different same same different different. Do the month thing counter. Clock counter counter clockwise counter six 10027. Got to bonk the butt. Shh. I doubt there's a mod here, but I'm bonking the bod. I'm dealing with this needy. I might as well use the bonk emote that I said I wasn't afraid to use at the start of stream. Where are you? Bonk. There you go. There's your bonk. Um, let's see. Um J uh with spade and a five. There it is. Heart from there. Is that Beta is a plus five which is fine. And then club is too much. Club counterclockwise. So C H S D. Um 68. Uh, Quebec is 12, which means I can hit there and then another time that's uh not going to work. So, spades uh move them clockwise. So, C D S H. So, we have two above it is an A. Two above it is an A. Um, a of diamonds. That's five. Parts is + one. Um, parts again is + three. Parts again is + 8. Diamonds is + three. Diamonds is + one. Um, clubs is plus two. Clubs is a king. That's way too much. Uh, fourth rotation and hyper cube. Why? Arrows are blue. It's time stamp is even click the message screen makes a sound message slate crosshair is red. Um that's the winter summer debate allows me to stay inside and avoid talking to people. I hate trying to appear so flexibly play with my dollhouse. So against Digit Springs. Digit Springs. Let's get to there. So we go this way. Launching the missile in tminus 3 2 1. Target neutralized. No. Skull cop. comes in. Yes. Second condition is true. Follow the black arrow if available. Otherwise, follow the white arrow. Okay. Wine glass. Shot a glass. Um, wine glass. Yes. Shot glass. No. Or other way around. Um, otherwise follow the black arrow. Well, um, even number of battery holders. Yes. Follow the black arrow. Seven. Okay. Um, first digit is one, the sum is eight. Don't have any zero nonsense. Um, the pig is minus five. - 5 + 15, that's 10. I didn't need to have uh don't need to be a rocket scientist to tell you that. Um, 3 + 21, right? So, I think that's what 3 * 7 is. um - 15 is nine. That's here. Gray MIG is 15 plus 1 2 3 4. Um and then jungle SC A is -6 + 15 is 9 which are already accounted for. Okay. So, Down left. Down left. Down left. Up left. Sure. Okay. Macro memories. Um, top and bottom. Top one is a five. Third position that has a button with the label two. Third position is a seven. What's the button with the label that was pressed in previous activation? That was third position on the bottom. I don't think which module like I press a button actually ever matters, but I'm too used to it. Um, press the button on the second position on the previously active module. Second position. He's a six. Oh my goodness. Are you going to Are you going to do this to me? Really? Make it lame. Uh, press the button with the label that was pressed in stage three. That's fourth position on the top. It's got to be lame, dude. Great. I press button the fourth position on the module that has button with the label that was pressed in stage one. Fourth position on the top module is a five. Uh, yeah. Now we deal with sevens. A second position on the active module happens to be two. Another seven. Press the one with the label that was pressed in stage one. First position on the top. And I think writing it all out actually helps me figure things out. So, I'm going to keep doing it even if it doesn't matter for future stages. That's the button in the same position as the button labeled four. That's the fourth position on the module that was active two activations ago. Fourth position on the bottom module. Don't mess that up. Uh is two. Um one. I'm glad I caught myself. Um, press button the second position on the module that was active to activate. Second position is a four and then six. Don't bother writing things down. Press button with the same label that was pressed in stage one. Cool. drink rum again. Um, you did do shots. You did do shots. Um, it is a spirit. It was a donor kebab. Um, you did not get sick. Uh, you did do shots. Yeah. Black coffee. Pack of Oreos. No. F pack of Oreos. Is this what? Yeah. Two raw eggs. Entire can of Red Bull. Whole pizza whisk. Um, no. It does not have two wheels. Yes, it's missing the front wheel. Um, display part yellow. Yes. Handlearts discolored. Yes. Fem individual. No. A person's shirt have a letter on it. Yes. The green. Funny. Nice try. Okay. Did that. Why would you say the same thing twice and ask me to ignore one of them? You idiot module. Um idiot sandwich module, if you will. Okay. Top half of the grid. Um, knights move to empty. Um, nothing to my knowledge happened. Um, two backgrounds orthogonal. That one's too many. That one's not enough. That one's too many. To an empty cell. Top half. Uh, three patterns diagonal. Well, that can't happen on an edge. Um, three patterns diagonal striped two backgrounds orthogonal top half knights to an empty 6 43 5 6 4 3 5 Number of serial number digits. Eight 6 4 3 5 That is a square. First digit is not even row. First blue scan. 1 4 5 1 batteries plus ports squared. That's four. 451 green scan 413 2 + 14 - 12 is 4 413 is vertical there blue head. Four. One, two, three, five. Yellow. Red. four four plus it doesn't matter. Um yeah, just four 90. We are chilling. 28 What? Candy, octagon. I see paint and shirts in that order. 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 8 + 4 is 12 counterclockwise. Read the [ __ ] rules this time. Yellow must be on the same road. I'm not taking chances. So it's the other one I think. Yeah, it's well actually four minus five and then you add 25 that's 24 W. Okay. So it's minus Yeah. -4. What? Okay, maybe I'm mistaken somewhere. Um, that's R. Oh, royalty. with W you have three fully extended. So that would be this delta over here. Okay. I might have gotten lucky there, but it's fine. I didn't strike. That's what matters. Oh, no. It was the first cuz it was five. Okay. Um I am yapping too much. Who these who is they they how they how is these these why these why is that that when that when is they they what they What is those? Those where those where is these um royalty over What's purple rule? Purple rule is alternate between the Oh, neither of them are following the rules. Um, sec third correct queer response is 28. It's just this. Please get out of here. Thank you. Meme taught tilt lack. Yeah, I'll do the border around the edge. Why not? Um, you can see how shaky my hands are. So that that um L is like this. We need this to escape. Need these to escape. Need these to escape. Obviously need these to escape. We need this to go down somewhere. Um I don't think if this were that then this would need to escape somewhere but then that would be the same as that. So that's wrong. Um I think this is the bottom left corner. And if so, that finishes it. Just make sure there's no other duplicates. I don't see it. Second question is how that position was tango. Initially pressed on veraricolored was yellow. Ha! I didn't strike, right? I didn't strike. Holy [ __ ] Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh my god. Yes. Thank you. Uh yes. Okay. I didn't beat denial by 10 seconds, but I don't care. I didn't [ __ ] strike. Okay. I'm I'm gonna be brutally honest for a second, right? Uh first of all, thank you uh Pippy Pride Boulevard for making this ball with me. It really was um dream come true uh having uh played the game with y'all for charity a while back um for a GDQ thing. Um I want to al also say I do want to go to HDQ27. that's gonna be happening. Uh, hope to meet you all there. Um, but the other thing is, uh, slightly more cynical, which is that, uh, I'm a little pissed at myself that I waited to put this bomb on the site because had I not waited, this wouldn't have been season legal, which meant that Dan wouldn't have beaten me to it. Uh, so there's that, I guess. But whatever. It's fine. I did the bomb. I didn't strike. So, that's what I'm going to boast about and brag about. Yes, I am so happy that this bomb is done. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it.
